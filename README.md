# Cardiomegaly-Detection-in-Dogs-Using-GoogLeNet
Vertebral Heart Size (VHS) measurement is a critical metric for assessing cardiomegaly in dogs, enabling veterinarians to diagnose and monitor cardiac health effectively. This study proposes a deep learning-based object detection and keypoint localization approach using PyTorch and the GoogLeNet architecture to automate VHS calculation.
